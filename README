mod_scrambleip - scramble information about the remote IP

This module scrambles the information on the remote IP and
hostname right at the beginning of handling the request.  That means
the clear IP is not logged, is not available to any web apps, and can't leak
into error logs and the like.

Its written as an lighter approach to mod_removeip which sets every request to
localhost/127.0.0.1.

mod_scrambleip uses the following method:

IPv4: The first 4 bytes are kept, bytes 5+6 are XORed with 0x55, the last ones with 0xAA
IPV6: First block is kept, the second and last block are removed and always set to 0, 
      the blocks in between are XORed with 0x5A

There is currently no facility for enabling the module on a per site
or per directory basis.

Compile and install for Apache2:
make scrambleip
make install

config should look for example like this:

/etc/apache2/modules.d/99_scrambleip.conf 
LoadModule scrambleip_module    modules/mod_scrambleip.so
SCRAMBLEIPenable On
